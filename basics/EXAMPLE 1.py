#We should create a function that ‘findsgrade’ by
#taking in marks of each subject as parameters
#calculating total from the parameters(subjects) passed
#calculating the average from the total
#using if statement to find grade
#what if I want to get total marks! and average?

def findgGrade (Maths,Eng,Kisw,Bio,Chem):
    total= Maths+Eng+kisw+Bio+Chem
    Avg = total/5
    print (total)
    print (Avg)

#write a function called sum-digits that is given an integer num and returns the sum of the digits of num
def sum_digits (num):
    tostr =str (num) #convert


#Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
def addEven():
    Anynumber input ("Enter a number")
    #evaluate the number and print out appropriate messages
    if int(anyNumber)
