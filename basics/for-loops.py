#1.write a program that prints your name 100 times using a while loop and a for loop
name ="Patricia Wanjiku"
a = 0

print ("Patricia Wanjiku")
a < 100
while a < 100:
    print ("name")
    a+= 1

name = "Patricia Wanjiku"
for i in range (100):
    print (str(i + name))

#2. write a program that outputs 100 lines, numbers 1 to 100 each with your name
#example
#1. patricia wanjiku
#2. patricia wanjiku

#3,write a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 8, 11, 14, 17,20,,,,upto 83,86,89
#"a = 8
#while 8 <=a < 92
 #   print (a)
  #  a+=3


#4,write a program that prints the first 20 numbers and their squares and their cubes, use both a for loop and a while loop example is
#1...1...1
#2....4....8
#3....9...27
